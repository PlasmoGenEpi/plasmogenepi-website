          Now that you have validated your labâ€™s genotyping data, you are ready
          to test the samples from your malaria indicator survey!
        </p>
        <p>
          These samples are collected from across your country and therefore
          should be broadly representative of what is going on. In this step of
          the activity, you will analyze 10 genotyped infections so you can
          finish this activity in a reasonable amount of time, but we will
          assume that they are representative of your full sample which is much
          larger.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to estimate the MOI for each one, based on your
          experience analyzing data from controls. Then you will calculate the
          mean MOI and interpret your results to determine if your vector
          control interventions are working.
        </p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>

          Before you continue to Step 3, let's take a moment to think about the
          relationship between MOI and the impact of your vector control
          interventions.

          Recall from the beginning of the activity that have DBS stored from a
          recent malaria indicator survey and historic data showing average MOI
          was 2.5 before the intervention.
