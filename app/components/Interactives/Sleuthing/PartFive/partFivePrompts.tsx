          Despite implementing a new intervention, there did not seem to be any
          decrease in MOI, which might have been expected with a decrease in
          transmission. In fact, MOI increased from 2.0 to 2.8!
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sufficient sample size, a difference of this magnitude would
          likely have been statistically significant, indicating that
          transmission may have actually increased despite, or potentially
          because of, the change in interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may not surprise those working in malaria control â€“ sometimes
          interventions that are supposed to work based on data from controlled
          settings actually behave differently when implemented in the field.
          Hopefully your investigation and analysis of the data helped identify
          this important result. You are now able to communicate this
          information to others in your program and think about additional
          actions.
