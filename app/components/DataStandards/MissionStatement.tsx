        With generation of amplicon sequencing data for Plasmodium accelerating,
        there is a timely opportunity to create shared resources to disseminate,
        reuse, and analyze these data. However, there is currently no standard
        for lossless representation microhaplotypes derived from these
        approaches nor for associated laboratory, bioinformatic, and clinical
        metadata. A standardized format for microhaplotype data would facilitate
        data sharing, including development of appropriate repositories, along
        with transparency and reproducibility of analysis. Standardization at
        this central step in analysis would also allow for alignment of
        downstream tools, increasing incentives to develop robust, reusable
        software and allow cross-study analyses.
